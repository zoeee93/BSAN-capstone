You should go through 3 "sprints" over the capstone project.

The minimum length of a sprint should be 2 weeks and the maximum should be 5 weeks.

You should simply attempt to plan a set of activities and then work to execute on those activities.

This is a very simple minimum starter.  You are welcome to incorporate more advanced methods and tools for planing.
